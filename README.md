1. I have an excel , by default the columns are not expanded and so I am not able to read the whole test in column, I want to expand all the columns in a single click
how to do

Ans:
Select All Columns:
Click the small triangle at the intersection of the row and column headers, located in the top-left corner of the worksheet. This will select the entire worksheet.

AutoFit Column Width:
Once all columns are selected, double-click the boundary to the right of any column header. This will automatically resize all columns to fit the contents.
